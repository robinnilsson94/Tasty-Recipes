           Wow, what a nice surprise! This recipe was outstanding! I read close to 200 books before I made these up and this is what I came up with: I doubled the recipe to make sure I had enough for four of us as others felt that the serving size is off, I have a ton of batter leftover (good for me, it will keep). I let the eggs come to room temp, heated the milk just a tad so that when it was added to the melted butter it would not re-solidify the butter, I used 1/8 cup of sugar, a whole stick of real butter melted all the way through, only 4 TBS of baking powder and 3/4 tsp salt. I also added a splash of vanilla. I mixed wet and dry ingredients seperately. Then when I put the wet into the flour I used a whisk sparingly and it came together beautifully with no lumps. I let the mixture sit for about 10 minutes before starting to make the pancakes. Other said that they had problems with the batter being too thick, I think that using less baking powder and making sure that the wet ingredients were not cold made a big difference. These came out absolutely beautiful and like something out of a magazine. I served this with bacon and fresh strawberries tossed with sugar. Yummy! I will experiment a bit more in the future but this is a great recipe! Thanks Verona for sharing and thanks to reviewers also for sharing their comments! Reviewed on: 30-01-2001
