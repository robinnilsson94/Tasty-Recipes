            Tastes decent, but the dish doesn't look at all like it does on your sites photo. And also I wanted more than just 1/2 teaspoon salt. Reviewed on: 22-04-1998

             I'd say there is a fifty percent chance I cook this dish again within 25 years or so. The texture of these balls are rather inspectacular, otherwise great taste. End of review. Reviewed on: 23-04-1998
